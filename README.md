What’s Inside?
detect hashes.txt
This file is a wannabe blacklist of SHA1 hashes for various known cheats, spoofers, and cleaners. Spoiler: 90% of these tools are public, outdated, or renamed in two seconds. Enjoy trying to catch "Free Cheat" with a static hash 😂​

mas detect strings.txt / detect strings.txt
Literal string comparisons like tzx.zip, settings.cock (nice), and even DLLs like USBDeview.dll. A 10-year-old malware scanner could do better. They even detect their own leaked rar passwords... zero obfuscation, zero effort​​

1.txt + 2.txt
Bizarre detection logic and randomized junk code wrapped in some pseudo-crypto and XOR loops. It's like they watched a reversing video once and decided “yo let’s just paste hex around until it looks ‘leet’.” Pure comedy​​

rules.txt
A YARA rule zoo. Detections for generic DLLs (d3d11.dll, ole32.dll), buzzwords like “process hollowing”, and even whole memory dumps of suspected loader text. If your cheat prints “Loader started” it’s over for you… unless you change a word. Rip Echo.​

detect code.txt
Imported from LOLDrivers GitHub repo with minimal changes. Tries to identify vulnerable drivers by checking PE headers. Actually the only slightly useful part — but again, public and outdated​

Echo Anticheat – "Security" So Bad It Leaks Itself 🫠
The entire thing is a meme. No integrity checks, no proper obfuscation, no dynamic analysis — just static YARA + hardcoded strings. Anyone using custom firmware or even slightly modified binaries will pass through undetected.

And now it’s all out here. .exe, source code, hashes, detection logic — you name it.

🗂️ Grab the source, learn how not to build anticheat, and maybe build your own for laughs. Echo Anticheat? More like Echo Chamber, because no real threats are bouncing off this.
